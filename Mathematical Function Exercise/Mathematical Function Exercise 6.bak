%(a) Create a program generates a random value between 1 and N, where N is an integer specified by the user.
%(b) Modify your program to allow the user to specify the starting value and the ending value, both integers.
%(c) Modify your program to allow the user to specify the integer step between values.  For example, numbers between -5 and 5 with a step of 2 could be (at random) -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5. 
%(d) Modify your program so all values are real (decimal) values.
